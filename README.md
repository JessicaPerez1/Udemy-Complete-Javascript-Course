# UDEMY COMPLETE JAVASCRIPT COURSE

## Description

This repository includes all courses, activites and projects that I have completed for the online "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert." It has a total of 314 lectures and 68.5 hours of video.

5 real-world projects that teaches how to plan and architect applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns.

1. JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings...
2. JavaScript (ES6+): arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020)...
3. How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values...
4. Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
5. Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
6. Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls.
7. Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules
